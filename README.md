# File Copier
This is a simple cross-platform C# .NET 6 program that copies files that match a certain file name pattern into a chosen directory (with file overwrite), based on a configuration JSON file, and optionally automatically, every time file changes are detected.

## Why?
This can be useful for Lua scripting for Aseprite in a Git repo, while maintaining settings to automatically copy the lua scripts into your Aseprite's script installation file path.
